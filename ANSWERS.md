- [x] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
    To access the react lifecycle methods.

- [x] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
    constructor - initialize local state pass props
	componentDidMount - runs after components have been rendered properly (typically used to make API calls.)
	componentDidUpdate - runs after state has been changed. Compare prevprops or state to current state and make changes based on that

- [x] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
    to reuse logic in other components

- [x] Why is it important to test our apps?
    surface bugs, allows us to trust the code, makes us think about edge cases
